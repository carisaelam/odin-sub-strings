# Sub-strings Ruby project for TOP 

For this project, I successfully implemented a substring search method in Ruby. Utilizing the provided dictionary, I developed a function that takes a single word as input and returns a list of words from the dictionary that contain that word as a substring. By iterating through each word in the dictionary and checking if the input word is a substring of it, I generated the desired list. This project enhanced my understanding of string manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving in Ruby, contributing to my proficiency in programming with the language.
